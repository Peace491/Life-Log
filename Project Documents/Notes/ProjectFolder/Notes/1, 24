Team reviews are mainly based off of scrum, discipline and accuracy of project plan timeline.

Code reviews include everything that you have done for your feature/showcase item, something that is missing will 
result in minus points, there will be a rubric automated testing is a must

Homework/assignments are more front end heavy and will provide help with learning UI

Final “Quiz” is what we learned this semester

Final Project is the presentation and completion of the project, can ask for reimbursement for expenses on the 
senior project, grade mainly based off of what you delivered and how complete the code is.

There is a peer review for every code review that is done, a team member will provide a review of what that person 
presented and is part of the code review submission and the peer review is for a grade.

Client -> Internet -> |Edge|  Server -> Database(or third party services)

The Edge or DMZ is the first component to the network which is made up of public IP’s and address, everything after 
that is all private the only way you can enter is through the Edge there is no way to enter the private area besides getting caught, the firewall is within the Edge it can either be a hardware(expensive faster) or software(cheap slower) 

The firewall blocks traffic via IP, Port, Region or HTTP, typically there are two firewalls one at the entrance into 
the edge and one at the exit of the edge 

Reverse Proxy: is for routing traffic
Pass thru: no routing just plug and chug

Anytime you need more performance you will need to load balance

Data propagation: once data is saved in a server it will be pushed to other servers
