# Project Description

The Lifelog web app aims to enhance users' lives by helping them achieve their dreams and aspirations. Lifelog provides a platform that generates meaningful recommendations of new activities to enrich users lives, and foster life change. Team Peace sets out to help people change their lifestyles with Lifelog.

Initially we will deploy the Lifelog application online as a single page web application. There will be support for the desktop version of Chrome on standard display resolution (1920 x 1080), and the mobile version of Chrome, as a single page web application. The app will initially be deployed specifically to Los Angeles County and its Market, meaning it will initially only cover the Pacific time zone.  Lifelog will have potential to expand to the rest of the US market place and cover all US time zones (EST, MST, CST). The supported language will be American English. Units of measurement will be US based (Imperial system). Lifelog uses a 12-hour clock.

# Design

Prior to coding we collected the application requirements from our client, in this case our Professor Vatanak Vong. Throughout the process, our professor acted as the client, and we collected requirements and demonstrated parts of the application to him, in sections of code called "Milestones"

We presented the design and structure of our code to our client before implementaiton began. The design was demonstrated with a High Level Design and Addendum, a Project Plan that includes a Gantt Chart, Project Roadmap and Sitemap, Network Diagram, Data Access LLD, Logging LLD, Security Library LLD and User Management Library LLD.
